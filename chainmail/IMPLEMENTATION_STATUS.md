# ChainMail Implementation Summary

## âœ… Completed Features

### 1. Relay Wallet System (Gas-Free for Users)
- Created `/src/app/api/relay/send-email/route.ts` - API endpoint for sending emails via relay
- Created `/src/app/api/relay/register-key/route.ts` - API endpoint for registering public keys via relay
- Created `/src/services/relay.service.ts` - Relay wallet service (server-side only)
- Added `BlockchainService.logEmailSendRelay()` - Send emails without user paying gas
- Added `BlockchainService.registerPublicKeyRelay()` - Register keys without user paying gas
- Updated `EmailService.sendEmail()` to use relay
- Updated login flow to use relay for key registration

**Setup Required:**
1. Add your relay wallet private key to `.env.local`:
   ```
   RELAY_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```
2. Fund the relay wallet with BDAG tokens
3. Deploy the updated `ChainMail.sol` contract supplying the relay wallet address to the constructor, then update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAINMAIL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`

### 2. Persistent PGP Keys
- PGP keys are now stored with wallet address as key: `PGP_KEYS_{address}`
- Keys are generated deterministically from wallet private key
- On login, system checks for existing keys and reuses them
- No more key regeneration on each login
- Old emails can now be decrypted after re-login

## ðŸš§ Remaining Tasks

### 3. Side Panel with Inbox/Sent Tabs
**Files to modify:**
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Add side navigation panel
- Need to add state for active tab ('inbox' | 'sent')
- Add tab switching UI

### 4. Sent Emails Display
**Files to modify:**
- `/src/app/page.tsx` - Add sent emails loading function
- Use `BlockchainService.getSenderEmails(address)` to fetch sent email IDs
- Display sent emails similar to inbox

### 5. Reply Threading
**Files to update:**
- Smart contract needs update to support `replyTo` field
- `/contracts/ChainMail.sol` - Add `uint256 replyTo` to Email struct
- Update `logSend` function to accept `replyTo` parameter
- Update frontend to show reply chains
- Add reply button to each email
- Show replied/reply status in email list

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
A. Implement the side panel with tabs first?
B. Implement sent emails display?
C. Implement reply threading?
D. All of the above?

Let me know which you'd like me to tackle next!
